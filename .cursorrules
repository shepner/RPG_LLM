# Cursor AI Assistant Workflow Rules

## Git Workflow
1. **ALWAYS commit changes** after making modifications to files
2. **ALWAYS push to repository** after committing (unless explicitly told not to)
3. Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed
4. Commit related changes together in logical groups
5. If multiple services are modified, commit them together with a summary message

## Docker Workflow
1. **ALWAYS rebuild containers** after code changes:
   - Use `docker compose build <service>` for individual services
   - Use `docker compose build` for all services
   - Use `docker compose up -d --build` to rebuild and restart
2. **ALWAYS restart services** after rebuilding to ensure new code is running
3. Check container logs if services fail after rebuild
4. Verify services are healthy after rebuild

## Code Changes Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Test locally if possible
3. **Commit changes** with descriptive message
4. **Push to repository**
5. **Rebuild affected containers**
6. **Restart services**
7. Verify services are working

## Exception Cases
- If user explicitly says "don't commit" or "don't push", skip those steps
- If rebuilding would take too long and user needs quick testing, mention it but still rebuild
- Always inform user when committing/pushing/rebuilding
